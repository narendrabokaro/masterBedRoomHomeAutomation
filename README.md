Automation project related to my master bedroom requirement.

There is a challenging situation in my master bedroom (MBR) where the main switchboard is given in a place that is the idle location for keeping the bed. But the only problem with this setup is that your bed will completely block the switchboard. So basically you need to cross all the way to reach the other side of the bed to access the switchboard to on/off the fan and tube light which is really frustrating.
